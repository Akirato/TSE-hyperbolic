# TSE-hyperbolic
Taylor Series Expansion based Hyperbolic Layers

The repository contains code for the paper "Towards Practical Hyperbolic Neural Networks using Taylor Series Approximations"

The four experiments are provided in the four directories:
1. Graph: /TS-hyperbolic-layers
2. Multi-relational Reasoning: /multirelational-normalized
3. Computer Vision: /taylor-image-embeddings
4. NLP: /taylor-hyrnn

The datasets for Graph and Multi-relational Reasoning can be downloaded here [https://data.world/reddy-lab/ptse-hyperbolic-networks].
The datasets for Computer Vision and NLP experiments have download scripts in the respective folders.

The reproducibility experiments are also provided in the individual directories.
